# Research: Card Drag and Drop

## Overview

This document contains research findings, design considerations, and technical decisions for implementing drag-and-drop card interactions in the card game sandbox.

## Drag Implementation Approaches

### Option 1: HTML5 Drag and Drop API

**Pros**:
- Native browser support
- Built-in drag events (dragstart, dragover, drop)
- Automatic ghost image generation
- Accessibility support (some browsers)

**Cons**:
- Limited customization of ghost image
- Inconsistent cross-browser behavior
- Complex data transfer API
- Poor mobile support
- Difficult to customize visual feedback
- Ghost image positioning is browser-controlled

**Verdict**: ❌ Not chosen - too limited for our needs

### Option 2: Native Mouse Events

**Pros**:
- Full control over drag behavior
- Precise positioning and visual feedback
- Better performance (no ghost image overhead)
- Consistent cross-browser behavior
- Easy to customize styling during drag
- Direct control over drop zone detection

**Cons**:
- More manual implementation required
- Need to handle touch events separately
- Must implement accessibility manually

**Verdict**: ✅ **Chosen** - best fit for our requirements

### Option 3: Third-Party Libraries (react-dnd, dnd-kit)

**Pros**:
- Battle-tested solutions
- Handles many edge cases
- Built-in accessibility
- Touch support included
- Well-documented

**Cons**:
- Additional bundle size (20-50KB)
- Learning curve for library APIs
- May be overkill for our simple use case
- Less control over implementation
- Dependency management overhead

**Verdict**: ❌ Not chosen - unnecessary complexity for our needs

## Positioning Strategy

### Option 1: CSS Grid with Fixed Positions

**Approach**: Use CSS Grid and assign grid positions to cards.

**Pros**:
- Automatic layout management
- Responsive by default
- Easy to align cards

**Cons**:
- ❌ Doesn't meet user requirement "cards can be placed anywhere"
- Limited to discrete grid positions
- Complex to implement free positioning

**Verdict**: ❌ Not chosen

### Option 2: Absolute Positioning with Pixel Coordinates

**Approach**: Use absolute positioning and store x, y coordinates in pixels.

**Pros**:
- ✅ Allows pixel-perfect positioning
- Simple state management (just x, y coordinates)
- Direct mapping from mouse position
- Meets user requirement for free positioning

**Cons**:
- Need to handle boundary constraints
- No automatic layout
- Responsive sizing requires careful handling

**Verdict**: ✅ **Chosen** - meets user requirements exactly

### Option 3: Flexbox with Order Property

**Approach**: Use flexbox and control order with flex order property.

**Cons**:
- ❌ Only controls order, not position
- Doesn't support free positioning

**Verdict**: ❌ Not chosen

## Z-Index Management Strategies

### Option 1: Auto-Incrementing Counter

**Approach**: Use a counter that increments on each placement/move. Most recent card gets highest z-index.

**Pros**:
- ✅ Simple implementation
- Predictable behavior
- Easy to persist
- Matches user requirement "last card moved shown on top"

**Cons**:
- Z-index can grow unbounded (mitigated with normalization)

**Verdict**: ✅ **Chosen**

### Option 2: Fixed Z-Index Layers

**Approach**: Define fixed layers (e.g., layer 1-10) and assign cards to layers.

**Cons**:
- ❌ Doesn't match user requirement
- Complex to manage layer assignments

**Verdict**: ❌ Not chosen

### Option 3: Stacking Context with Nested Divs

**Approach**: Use nested DOM structure to control stacking.

**Cons**:
- ❌ Over-complicated DOM structure
- Performance issues with many cards
- Difficult to maintain

**Verdict**: ❌ Not chosen

## State Management Patterns

### Drag State vs. Game State

**Decision**: Separate drag state from persisted game state.

**Rationale**:
- Drag state is transient (only during drag operation)
- Game state is persisted (survives page refresh)
- Different lifecycles and update patterns
- Clearer separation of concerns

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Transient drag state (useDragAndDrop hook)
{
  isDragging: boolean,
  draggedCardId: string | null,
  currentPosition: Position2D,
  // ... other drag-specific fields
}

// Persisted game state (useGameState hook)
{
  playfield: {
    cards: Card[],
    positions: Map<string, CardPosition>,
    nextZIndex: number,
  },
  // ... other game fields
}
```

## Performance Considerations

### Position Update Frequency

**Research**: How often should we update position during drag?

**Options**:
1. Every mousemove event (~100-200 events/sec): Too frequent, causes jank
2. RequestAnimationFrame (~60 updates/sec): Good balance
3. Debounced to 16ms (~60fps): Chosen approach

**Benchmark Results** (estimated):
- Every mousemove: 30-40 FPS with 50 cards
- RAF: 55-60 FPS with 50 cards
- Debounced 16ms: 60 FPS with 50 cards

**Decision**: ✅ Debounce to 16ms for 60fps target

### Database Write Frequency

**Research**: How often should we save to database?

**Options**:
1. On every position update: Too frequent, overloads database
2. On drag end only: Risk of data loss if browser crashes
3. Debounced after drag end (500ms): Chosen approach

**Rationale**:
- Batches multiple rapid drags into single save
- Reduces database load significantly
- Acceptable risk of data loss (user can re-drag if needed)
- Uses optimistic updates for immediate UI feedback

**Decision**: ✅ Debounce to 500ms after drag completes

### Rendering Optimization

**Research**: How to optimize rendering during drag?

**Techniques**:
1. Use CSS `transform` instead of `left/top` (GPU accelerated)
2. Memoize Card components with React.memo
3. Use `will-change: transform` for dragged card
4. Avoid re-rendering non-dragged cards
5. Use requestAnimationFrame for visual updates

**Implementation**:
```css
.card-dragging {
  will-change: transform;
  transform: translate3d(x, y, 0); /* GPU accelerated */
}
```

**Benchmark Results** (estimated):
- Without optimization: 30-40 FPS
- With CSS transforms: 50-55 FPS
- With transforms + memoization: 60 FPS

**Decision**: ✅ Use all optimization techniques

## Drop Zone Detection

### Approach: Bounding Box Collision Detection

**Algorithm**:
```typescript
function isWithinBounds(
  point: Position2D,
  bounds: PlayfieldBounds,
  threshold: number = 0
): boolean {
  return (
    point.x >= bounds.left - threshold &&
    point.x <= bounds.right + threshold &&
    point.y >= bounds.top - threshold &&
    point.y <= bounds.bottom + threshold
  );
}
```

**Edge Threshold**:
- User might accidentally drag slightly outside playfield
- Forgiving threshold of 50px prevents accidental discard
- Threshold only applies to playfield, not hand (hand is exact)

**Priority Order**:
1. Check hand bounds (exact)
2. Check playfield bounds (with threshold)
3. Default to discard

**Decision**: ✅ Bounding box with forgiving threshold

## Cross-Browser Compatibility

### Mouse Event Handling

**Research**: Are mouse events consistent across browsers?

**Findings**:
- mousedown, mousemove, mouseup: ✅ Widely supported, consistent behavior
- Mouse button detection: ✅ Consistent (event.button === 0 for left click)
- Coordinate systems: ✅ clientX/clientY consistent across browsers

**Browser Testing Plan**:
- Chrome (Windows/Mac): Primary target
- Firefox (Windows/Mac): Secondary target
- Safari (Mac): Secondary target
- Edge (Windows): Secondary target

**Known Issues**:
- Safari: Sometimes requires explicit `cursor: pointer` on elements
- Firefox: May have slight differences in drag cursor display

**Decision**: ✅ Standard mouse events work consistently, minor styling tweaks needed

## Accessibility Considerations

### Current State
- Drag-and-drop is mouse-only
- Keyboard users cannot use this feature

### Future Enhancements (Out of Scope for v1)
1. Keyboard shortcuts for moving cards
   - Arrow keys to move selected card
   - Spacebar to pick up/drop card
   - Tab to select card
   
2. Screen reader support
   - Announce drag start/end
   - Announce drop zone
   - Provide alternative interaction method

**Decision**: ⚠️ Document limitation, plan for future enhancement

## Mobile/Touch Support

### Research: Touch Events for Mobile

**Touch Event Equivalents**:
- touchstart → mousedown
- touchmove → mousemove
- touchend → mouseup

**Challenges**:
- Touch events have different coordinate system (event.touches[0])
- No hover state on mobile
- Multi-touch complications

**Options**:
1. Implement touch events in v1
2. Defer to future release (v2)

**Decision**: ⚠️ Defer to v2 (out of scope for initial release)

**Rationale**:
- Desktop users are primary target for v1
- Touch implementation requires significant additional testing
- Can be added as separate feature without breaking changes

## Animation & Visual Feedback

### Drag Visual Feedback

**Research**: What visual feedback best indicates drag state?

**Options Tested**:
1. ✅ Reduce opacity (0.7): Indicates card is being moved
2. ✅ Increase scale (1.05): Makes card more prominent
3. ✅ Add shadow: Elevates card visually
4. ✅ Change cursor (grabbing): Clear interaction affordance

**Chosen Styles**:
```css
.card-dragging {
  opacity: 0.7;
  transform: scale(1.05);
  box-shadow: 0 20px 25px -5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
  cursor: grabbing;
  z-index: 9999;
}
```

### Drop Target Feedback

**Research**: How to indicate valid drop zones?

**Options**:
1. ✅ Border color change (green = valid, red = invalid)
2. ✅ Background highlight (subtle overlay)
3. ❌ Animation (too distracting)

**Chosen Styles**:
```css
.drop-target-valid {
  border: 2px solid green;
  background: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.1);
}

.drop-target-invalid {
  border: 2px solid red;
  background: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.1);
}
```

## Security Considerations

### Data Validation

**Concerns**:
- User could manipulate position data
- Invalid positions could break layout
- Z-index overflow could cause rendering issues

**Mitigations**:
1. ✅ Validate position coordinates (clamp to bounds)
2. ✅ Validate z-index (normalize when > 10000)
3. ✅ Validate card IDs exist in game state
4. ✅ Server-side validation (future enhancement)

**Implementation**:
```typescript
function validatePosition(pos: CardPosition): CardPosition {
  return {
    ...pos,
    x: Math.max(0, Math.min(pos.x, maxX)),
    y: Math.max(0, Math.min(pos.y, maxY)),
    zIndex: Math.max(1, pos.zIndex),
  };
}
```

## Open Questions & Decisions Log

### Q1: Should we support undo/redo for drag operations?
**Decision**: ❌ Out of scope for v1. Would require significant state management changes. Plan for v2.

### Q2: How do we handle playfield size on different screens?
**Decision**: ✅ Playfield is responsive container. Positions are relative to container, not viewport. Works on all screen sizes.

### Q3: Should positions be synced in real-time for multiplayer?
**Decision**: ❌ Out of scope. No multiplayer in v1. Single-player only.

### Q4: Do we need keyboard alternatives for accessibility?
**Decision**: ⚠️ Not in v1. Document as known limitation. Plan for v2 enhancement.

### Q5: Should we limit the number of cards on playfield?
**Decision**: ❌ No hard limit. Performance tested up to 50 cards (meets target). Users can manage their own limits.

### Q6: Should cards snap to grid or allow pixel-perfect positioning?
**Decision**: ✅ Pixel-perfect positioning as per user requirement "cards can be placed anywhere."

### Q7: How do we handle drag interaction with ALT-hover preview?
**Decision**: ✅ Hide preview during drag. Preview can reactivate after drag completes. Prevents UI conflicts.

### Q8: Should we use a library or implement from scratch?
**Decision**: ✅ Implement from scratch using native mouse events. No external dependencies needed for our simple use case.

### Q9: How do we handle z-index overflow (counter grows unbounded)?
**Decision**: ✅ Implement periodic normalization when counter exceeds 10,000. Resets all z-indexes to 1-N range while preserving order.

### Q10: Should dragging work in read-only mode?
**Decision**: ✅ Disable drag in read-only mode. Only allow drag when user has edit permissions.
