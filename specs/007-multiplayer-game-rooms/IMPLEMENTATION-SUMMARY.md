## Technical Architecture

### Database-First Sync Strategy
```
Player Action → Local State Update → Supabase Database → Realtime Broadcast → Other Players
                     ↓
                  200ms latency
```

### Realtime Channels
1. **Postgres Changes**: Subscribe to table updates (game_sessions, players)
2. **Presence**: Track who's online (30s heartbeat, 60s offline threshold)
3. **Broadcast**: Send game actions (card_moved, card_rotated)

### State Management
- **Playfield State**: Shared JSONB in `game_sessions.playfield_state`
- **Hand State**: Private JSONB in `players.hand_state` (RLS protected)
- **Positions**: Map<cardId, {x, y, zIndex}>
- **Rotations**: Map<cardId, degrees>

### Security
- Row-Level Security (RLS) enforces private hand access
- Anonymous sessions (no authentication required)
- Creator-only permissions for closing rooms

---

## Key Features

### 1. Game Room Lobby
- **Browse Rooms**: Real-time list of open game rooms
- **Create Room**: Choose display name and max players (2-8)
- **Join Room**: One-click join with automatic player slot assignment
- **Room Info**: Shows current player count, creator, and online players
- **Live Updates**: Room list refreshes automatically via Realtime

### 2. Multiplayer Game Page
- **Shared Playfield**: All players see the same cards and positions
- **Private Hand**: Each player's hand visible only to them
- **Player List**: Sidebar showing all players with online status
- **Connection Status**: Real-time indicator at top of page
- **Leave/Close**: Leave room or close to new players (creator only)

### 3. Real-time Synchronization
- **Card Movement**: Instant sync when players drag cards
- **Presence**: Green indicators show who's online
- **Auto-reconnect**: Handles network disconnects gracefully
- **Optimistic Updates**: Local state updates immediately, syncs async

### 4. Session Management
- **Anonymous Play**: No sign-up required
- **24-hour Sessions**: Automatic expiration with cleanup
- **Display Names**: User-chosen, editable names
- **Session Persistence**: Survives page refresh (sessionStorage)

---

## Performance Characteristics

### Free Tier Budget (Supabase)
- **Message Limit**: 200k/month
- **Concurrent Connections**: 200
- **Estimated Capacity**: ~416 game sessions/month
  - Assumptions: 4 players, 30 min/session, 100ms update debounce
  - Formula: 200k / (4 players × 30 min × 60 sec/min × 10 updates/sec) = 416 sessions

### Latency
- **State Sync**: ~200ms (database write → broadcast → clients)
- **Presence**: 30s heartbeat interval
- **Offline Detection**: 60s threshold
- **Reconnection**: 2000ms delay between attempts

### Optimizations
- **Debounced Updates**: 100ms for playfield changes
- **Z-index Normalization**: Reset when > 10,000
- **Lazy Loading**: Room list fetched on demand
- **Optimistic UI**: Instant local updates

## Testing Checklist

### ✅ Completed Manual Tests
1. Create game room with valid display name
2. Join game room from second browser/tab
3. Verify player list shows both players
4. Verify online status indicators (green dots)
5. Draw cards and verify hand updates
6. Drag card to playfield and verify sync to other player
7. Move card on playfield and verify position sync
8. Close game room and verify new players blocked
9. Leave game room and verify player count updates
10. Disconnect/reconnect and verify presence updates

### Browser Compatibility
- ✅ Chrome/Edge (primary)
- ✅ Firefox
- ✅ Safari
- ✅ Mobile browsers (responsive design)

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Anonymous Sessions**: No persistent user accounts (24h expiry)
2. **No Game History**: Games don't persist after all players leave
3. **No Spectator Mode**: Must join as player to view
4. **Fixed Playfield**: 1200x500px (not resizable)
5. **No Voice/Video**: Text-only interactions
6. **No Chat**: No in-game messaging yet
7. **No Turn System**: Free-form play only

---

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

### Phase 4-9 (Deferred)
- Turn-based gameplay with indicators
- Chat system for player communication
- Game invitations via shareable links
- Persistent rooms (survive disconnects)
- Spectator mode
- Mobile-first responsive improvements
- Accessibility enhancements
- Performance monitoring

---

## How to Use

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
- Check Supabase credentials in `.env.local`
- Verify Realtime enabled in Supabase dashboard
- Check browser console for WebSocket errors
- Verify migration 002 was applied

### State Sync Issues

- Clear old game sessions from database

---

## Code Quality

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Database-First Sync**: Simple, reliable, guaranteed consistency
2. **Supabase Realtime**: Easy WebSocket setup, built-in presence
3. **Type Generation**: Auto-generated types from database schema
4. **Session Storage**: No backend needed for anonymous sessions
5. **JSONB**: Flexible storage for card positions and rotations

### Challenges Overcome
1. **Json Type Conversions**: Used `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify())` for JSONB
2. **RLS Policies**: Required careful policy design for private hands
3. **Auto-generated Types**: Used type extraction instead of direct imports
4. **React Hooks**: Solved setState in useEffect lint issues
5. **Realtime Subscriptions**: Proper cleanup with channel removal

### Best Practices Applied
1. Use TypeScript strict mode throughout
2. Centralize configuration in constants
3. Implement proper error boundaries
4. Add JSDoc comments for all exports
5. Use semantic HTML and ARIA labels
6. Test with multiple browsers/tabs
7. Handle edge cases (disconnects, max players, etc.)
