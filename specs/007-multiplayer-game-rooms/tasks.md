# Tasks: Multiplayer Game Rooms

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/007-multiplayer-game-rooms/`  
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/multiplayer-types.ts

**Note**: This project does NOT require test tasks. Focus on implementation, code quality, UX consistency, and performance per constitution principles.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story (6 stories: 3 P1, 2 P2, 1 P3) to enable independent implementation of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Database schema and type definitions that all user stories will need

- [ ] T001 Create database migration file at supabase/migrations/002_create_multiplayer_tables.sql with players table, game_sessions extensions, RLS policies, and triggers per data-model.md
- [ ] T002 Apply migration using Supabase CLI (npx supabase db push) and verify tables created successfully
- [ ] T003 [P] Extend app/lib/types/database.ts with Player and GameSession interfaces per contracts/multiplayer-types.ts
- [ ] T004 [P] Create app/lib/types/multiplayer.ts with PresenceState, ConnectionStatus, GameRoomState, and GameRoomAction types per contracts/multiplayer-types.ts

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core utilities and session management that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [ ] T005 Create app/lib/utils/player-session.ts with getOrCreatePlayerId, clearPlayerSession, getDisplayName, and setDisplayName functions using sessionStorage per quickstart.md
- [ ] T006 Create app/lib/utils/game-room.ts with createGameRoom, validateGameAccess, and canJoinGame helper functions with error handling
- [ ] T007 Modify app/lib/hooks/useSupabase.ts to add setPlayerIdContext function that configures app.player_id session variable for RLS policies
- [ ] T008 Test player ID generation and persistence across browser refreshes manually with console logs

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Create and Share Game Room (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Enable game room creation with shareable URLs and basic join flow so two players can access the same game

**Independent Test**: Create a new game, copy URL, open in another browser tab, verify both tabs can access same game room

- [ ] T010 [P] [US1] Create app/lib/hooks/useGameRoom.ts with createGame function that INSERTs into game_sessions table and returns game ID
- [ ] T011 [US1] Implement createGame handler in GameRoomLobby that creates game, stores creator player_id, and redirects to /game/{id} route
- [ ] T012 [US1] Create app/game/[id]/page.tsx dynamic route with game ID parameter extraction and basic page structure
- [ ] T013 [US1] Implement joinGame logic in game/[id]/page.tsx that validates game exists, checks is_closed and player_count, displays error messages if cannot join
- [ ] T014 [US1] Add player INSERT logic in game/[id]/page.tsx that creates player record with player_id from sessionStorage and is_creator flag for first player
- [ ] T015 [US1] Create app/components/game/PlayerList.tsx component that displays all players with display_name and player_count, using Tailwind grid layout

- [ ] T049 [US4] Add channel cleanup logic to useRealtimeGameRoom that calls supabase.removeChannel when component unmounts or game closes
- [ ] T050 [US4] Create app/components/game/GameErrorMessage.tsx reusable component for displaying error states (closed, full, not found) with consistent styling
- [ ] T051 [US4] Add responsive layout for CloseGameButton and error messages using Tailwind breakpoints
- [ ] T052 [US4] Implement dark mode support for CloseGameButton and GameErrorMessage components
- [ ] T053 [US4] Add keyboard accessibility for CloseGameButton (Space/Enter to trigger) and ARIA labels for error states
- [ ] T054 [US4] Verify creator can close game, all players notified, new joins blocked, and 5th player cannot join full game

**Checkpoint**: At this point, game lifecycle management works with proper permissions, limits, and user notifications

---

## Phase 7: User Story 5 - Player Reconnection (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Players can reconnect after browser refresh or network interruption without losing their game state

**Independent Test**: Join game, refresh browser, verify auto-rejoin with same player_id, display_name, and hand cards intact

- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-8)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can proceed in parallel (if staffed) after Phase 2
  - Or sequentially in priority order: US1 (P1) ‚Üí US2 (P1) ‚Üí US3 (P1) ‚Üí US4 (P2) ‚Üí US5 (P2) ‚Üí US6 (P3)
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on US1, US2, US3 (P1 stories) being complete for MVP

### User Story Dependencies

- **US1 (Create/Join)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
- **US2 (Realtime Sync)**: Can start after Foundational - Integrates with US1 but independently testable

## Notes

- **[P] tasks** = different files, no dependencies within phase
- **[Story] label** maps task to specific user story for traceability
- **Each user story** should be independently completable and testable
- **No test tasks** per project constitution (focus on manual validation)
- **Constitution compliance**: All tasks follow Type Safety, Component-First, UX Consistency, Performance principles
- **Manual validation** focuses on UX consistency, accessibility, dark mode, and performance
- **Commit** after each task or logical group of related tasks
- **Stop at checkpoints** to validate story independently with multi-tab testing
- **Time estimates**: Setup ~1h, Foundational ~2h, each P1 story ~4h, each P2 story ~3-4h, P3 ~3h, Polish ~4h
