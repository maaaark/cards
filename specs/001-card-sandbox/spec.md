# Feature Specification: Card Sandbox Playfield

**Feature Branch**: `001-card-sandbox`  
**Created**: 2025-10-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a sandbox playfield with a card deck on it. I should be able to draw cards by clicking on the deck. Cards on my hand are displayed fixed on the bottom on my screen. If i click on a card on my hand, it will be placed on the playfield, visible to everyone and it will be removed from my hand."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - View Playfield with Deck (Priority: P1)

As a player, I want to see a playfield with a card deck displayed on it, so I can start interacting with the game.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundation of the entire feature. Without a playfield and deck, no other interactions are possible. This establishes the basic visual structure.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by loading the page and visually confirming that a playfield area is displayed with a card deck visible on it. Delivers immediate value by showing the game interface.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I open the application, **When** the page loads, **Then** I see a playfield area displayed on screen
2. **Given** the playfield is displayed, **When** I look at the playfield, **Then** I see a card deck positioned on it
3. **Given** the page is loaded, **When** I resize the browser window, **Then** the playfield remains responsive and properly sized

### User Story 2 - Draw Cards from Deck (Priority: P2)

As a player, I want to draw cards from the deck by clicking on it, so I can collect cards into my hand.

**Why this priority**: This enables the first interactive behavior - getting cards from the deck. Without this, players cannot progress in the game. This is the next logical step after seeing the playfield.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by clicking on the deck and verifying that cards appear in the hand area at the bottom of the screen. Delivers value by enabling card collection.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I see the deck on the playfield, **When** I click on the deck, **Then** a card is drawn and appears in my hand at the bottom of the screen
2. **Given** I have cards in my hand, **When** I click the deck again, **Then** another card is drawn and added to my hand
3. **Given** I draw multiple cards, **When** I look at my hand, **Then** all drawn cards are visible and organized in my hand area
4. **Given** cards are in my hand, **When** I resize the browser window, **Then** my hand area remains fixed at the bottom and cards remain visible

### User Story 3 - Play Cards to Playfield (Priority: P3)

As a player, I want to play cards from my hand to the playfield by clicking on them, so I can use cards in the game and make them visible to everyone.

**Why this priority**: This completes the basic card flow: deck → hand → playfield. It enables the core gameplay mechanic of playing cards.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by drawing cards, clicking a card in hand, and verifying it appears on the playfield and is removed from hand. Delivers value by enabling card play.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have cards in my hand, **When** I click on a card in my hand, **Then** the card is placed on the playfield in a visible location
2. **Given** a card is played to the playfield, **When** I look at my hand, **Then** the card is removed from my hand
3. **Given** I play multiple cards, **When** I look at the playfield, **Then** all played cards are visible and distinguishable from each other
4. **Given** cards are on the playfield, **When** I look at the playfield, **Then** the cards do not overlap the deck or obscure important UI elements

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the deck runs out of cards? (Player should not be able to draw more, or deck should indicate it's empty)
- How does the system handle rapid clicking on the deck? (Should prevent drawing too many cards at once or handle queued draws gracefully)
- What happens when the hand area has too many cards to display comfortably? (Cards should scale down, scroll, or fan out to fit)
- How are cards positioned when multiple cards are played to the playfield? (Should have a layout strategy to prevent overlap)
- What happens if a player tries to play a card when the playfield is full? (Should either prevent play or allow stacking with visual feedback)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST display a playfield area that serves as the main game surface
- **FR-002**: System MUST display a card deck on the playfield in a clearly visible location
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow players to draw a card by clicking on the deck
- **FR-004**: System MUST display a hand area fixed at the bottom of the screen that shows all cards in the player's hand
- **FR-005**: System MUST add drawn cards to the player's hand with visual feedback
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow players to play a card by clicking on it in their hand
- **FR-007**: System MUST place played cards on the playfield in a visible location
- **FR-008**: System MUST remove cards from the hand when they are played to the playfield
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain visual distinction between cards in hand and cards on the playfield
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain responsive layout across different screen sizes
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide visual feedback for interactive elements (deck, cards in hand)
- **FR-012**: System MUST handle the deck running out of cards gracefully (empty state indication)
- **FR-013**: Cards MUST have standard trading card proportions (63mm × 88mm / 2.5" × 3.5" ratio) suitable for poker or Magic: The Gathering style cards
- **FR-014**: System MUST support variable deck sizes to accommodate different card games (e.g., 52 cards for poker, 100 cards for MTG Commander)
- **FR-015**: For testing purposes, system MUST initialize with a 20-card test deck with cards labeled "Card 1" through "Card 20"
- **FR-016**: System MUST support future deck import functionality where cards are displayed as images (design for extensibility)

### Key Entities

- **Card**: Represents a single playing card with visual appearance (face/back), position (in deck, in hand, on playfield), and state (drawable, playable)
- **Deck**: Represents the collection of cards available to draw, with a count of remaining cards and visual representation
- **Hand**: Represents the player's current collection of cards, displayed at the bottom of the screen with fixed positioning
- **Playfield**: Represents the main game area where cards can be played, including the deck and played cards

### Assumptions

- Cards will use placeholder text labels initially ("Card 1", "Card 2", etc.) with plan to support image-based cards in future
- Single player experience for this version (no networking or multiplayer)
- No card state persistence (refreshing the page resets the game)
- Cards are drawn in sequential order from the deck
- Played cards remain visible on the playfield indefinitely (no card removal or discard pile)
- Standard browser with mouse/touch input support
- Test deck of 20 cards for initial implementation, with architecture supporting variable deck sizes
- Future deck import feature will load card images and metadata from external sources
