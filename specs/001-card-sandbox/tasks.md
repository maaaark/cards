# Tasks: Card Sandbox Playfield

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-card-sandbox/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Note**: This project does NOT require test tasks. Focus on implementation, code quality, UX consistency, and performance.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Web app**: `app/`, `app/components/`, `app/lib/`
- Paths shown below use Next.js App Router structure

---

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work - players can see playfield and draw cards into hand

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Play Cards to Playfield (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Enable clicking cards in hand to play them onto the playfield, removing them from hand

**Independent Test**: Draw cards, click card in hand, verify it appears on playfield and is removed from hand. Play multiple cards, verify all visible on playfield.

- [ ] T098 [P] Add JSDoc comments to all exported functions and components
- [ ] T099 [P] Create README.md in app/components/game/ documenting component usage
- [ ] T100 Final validation: run through complete user flow from quickstart.md and verify all acceptance scenarios pass

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) completion
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) AND User Story 1 completion (needs Card and Playfield components)
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) AND User Story 2 completion (needs Hand component and drawCard working)
- **Session & Import (Phase 6)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - can run parallel with user stories or after
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: No dependencies on other stories - foundation
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Depends on User Story 1 (needs Playfield and Card components)
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Depends on User Story 2 (needs Hand component)

### Within Each User Story

- Components marked [P] can be built in parallel
- Component integration tasks depend on individual components being complete
- Game page integration depends on all components for that story

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Within User Story 1: T022-T026 (Card), T027-T030 (Deck) can run in parallel
- Within User Story 2: T039-T043 (Hand) can be built while testing User Story 1
- Session & Import (Phase 6) can be developed in parallel with User Story 3

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch Card component tasks together:
Task: "Create Card component in app/components/game/Card.tsx with TypeScript CardProps interface"
Task: "Add dark mode support to Card component"
Task: "Add hover states to Card component"
Task: "Add ARIA labels to Card component"
Task: "Memoize Card component with React.memo"

# Launch Deck component tasks together (parallel with Card):
Task: "Create Deck component in app/components/game/Deck.tsx"
Task: "Add dark mode support to Deck component"
Task: "Add hover and disabled states to Deck component"
Task: "Add ARIA labels to Deck component"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Load page, verify playfield and deck visible, test responsive design, check dark mode
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Validate visuals and responsiveness ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Validate card drawing mechanics ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Validate card playing mechanics ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Add Session Persistence ‚Üí Validate state survives refresh
6. Add Deck Import ‚Üí Validate JSON import
7. Polish ‚Üí Final audit and optimization

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Playfield, Deck, Card components)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Hand component, drawCard logic) - starts after US1 components available
   - Developer C: Session Persistence & Deck Import (Phase 6)
3. Developer A ‚Üí User Story 3 after completing User Story 1
4. All converge on Polish phase

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable
- Manual validation focuses on UX consistency, accessibility, and performance
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence

---

## Task Summary

**Total Tasks**: 100
- Setup (Phase 1): 11 tasks
- Foundational (Phase 2): 10 tasks (BLOCKING)
- User Story 1 (Phase 3): 17 tasks
- User Story 2 (Phase 4): 15 tasks
- User Story 3 (Phase 5): 15 tasks
- Session & Import (Phase 6): 15 tasks
- Polish (Phase 7): 17 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**: 35+ tasks marked with [P] can run in parallel within their phases

**Independent Test Criteria**:
- US1: Load page ‚Üí see playfield and deck ‚Üí resize browser
- US2: Click deck ‚Üí cards appear in hand ‚Üí hand stays at bottom
- US3: Click card in hand ‚Üí appears on playfield ‚Üí removed from hand

**Suggested MVP Scope**: Complete through Phase 3 (User Story 1) for initial demo - playfield with visible deck and responsive design
