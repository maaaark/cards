# Specification Quality Checklist: Card Hover Preview with ALT Key

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: October 28, 2025  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

âœ… **All checklist items pass** - Specification is ready for planning phase.

### Details:

**Content Quality**: All sections focus on WHAT users need without specifying HOW to implement. Written in business language without technical jargon.

**Requirements**: All 18 functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-018) are specific, testable, and unambiguous. No clarification markers needed - all details have reasonable defaults based on standard UI patterns.

**Success Criteria**: All 13 criteria (SC-001 through SC-013) are measurable with specific metrics (time, fps, percentage) and technology-agnostic (no mention of React, hooks, CSS frameworks, etc.).

**User Scenarios**: Three prioritized stories (P1-P3) with clear acceptance criteria. Each story is independently testable and deliverable.

**Edge Cases**: Eight specific edge cases identified with expected behaviors defined inline.

**Scope**: Feature boundaries are clear - preview functionality for card inspection only, no modifications to existing card interactions or drag-drop operations.

## Notes

No issues found. Specification meets all quality criteria and is ready for `/speckit.plan` command.
