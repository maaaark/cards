- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain

- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Validation Status**: ✅ **PASSED** - All checklist items complete

**Key Points**:
- This is a refinement/cleanup feature built on top of feature 004 (Card Drag and Drop)
- Primary goal is to remove redundant click-to-place interaction
- Secondary goal is to verify existing playfield-to-hand drag works correctly
- No new functionality needed - all drag operations already implemented in feature 004
- Implementation is primarily removal of onClick handler from Hand component
- Very low risk - straightforward code removal with verification testing

**Dependencies**: Feature 004 (Card Drag and Drop) is complete and merged to main

**Assumptions**:
- Feature 004 implementation includes all necessary drag-drop functionality
- User Story 5 from feature 004 (drag playfield to hand) is fully implemented
- Drop zone detection and visual feedback already exist
- Game state actions (moveCardToHand, moveCardToPlayfield) already exist

**Ready for next phase**: ✅ Yes - Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan`
